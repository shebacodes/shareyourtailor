# ASO EBI STYLE
Aso Ebi is a Nigerian [insert description here] garment worn in varied designs to celebrate special occasions, primarily weddings, birthday celebrations and engagement parties. 

As the wedding industry develops further in Nigeria, there will be a continous need to source the services of tailors who can "build the look" for customers interested in mocking up styles they've seen from friends and family.

Aso Ebi Files *[Name to be determined] aims to provide looks for the client based on colors, tailor and style.
